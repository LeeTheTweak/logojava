          A brand is a name, a term, a design, a symbol, or any other feature that identifies one sellerâ€™s goods or services as different from those of other sellers.
          <br/><br/>Imagine your favorite restaurant or grocery store. 
          Now, when you imagine your favorite spot, what does the logo look like? What about the colors, typography, or the packaging of their goods, or the way the menu looks, or even the size of the business? Heck, even the way the business is handled.
          <br/><br/>All of these I just mentioned above are some of many aspects of what makes up a brand. What this site will be focusing on is the design aspects of a brand. The way the brand presents themselves 
          to consumers is very important, and design is no exception. 
          <br/><br/>I believe design is a very important part in branding; 
          its like dressing up to look good for a meeting. A business should always present themselves to be recognizable to consumers. Be unique and stand out from the rest is what makes a business unforgettable. 
        </p>

          The name for a brand can be just about anything. There are names that don't even relate to what
          the business will be producing, for example, Starbucks. Starbucks is a business that sells coffee 
          to its consumers, but its name has nothing to do with the product it sells. To be more specific, this 
          is a type of trademark known as a, <i>Arbitrary Mark</i>, a name that is used in a way that is unrelated
          to the product or services represented. We won't talk about this too much, just something extra to know. 
        </p>
        <br/>

          I believe that color touches the soul. When specific colors are seen in combination with one another, it gives
          the consumer a certain vibe. As a brand age over time, its colors also help the recognition of a business.
          Colors also play a big role into the human psyche. For example, did you know that red is almost, always seen in 
          every restaurant? Red seems to associate well with dinning:

          <img src="images/chipotleMenuPic.jpg"/>
          <img src="images/dennysPic.jpg"/>
          <p><i>Just a small list of restaurant brands with the color red in them.</i></p>

        <img class="right" src="images/typographyImage.png"/>
        <p>
          There are so many things that goes together to form brands that I just can't list
          all of them here. So instead, I divided each relevent topic into their own 
          articles. Besides, the focus here is design. Names and colors are just a few of 
          what makes a brand...well, a brand.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Slogans, fonts, and the whole typography for a brand's logo also have its fair share
          in forming a brand. The importance of typography all depends though. Typography can 
          be the star of the show, or in the background. Typography can have its own looks on logos,
          menus, pamphletes, packaging, signs, and even websites. I say, typography could also be 
          a brand's logo as a whole.
